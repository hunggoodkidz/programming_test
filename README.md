# Programming Test Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to execute the programming test using Python. The test consists of multiple questions (Q1 to Q4) implemented within a menu-based system.

## 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x (Recommended: Python 3.8 or later)
- A terminal or command prompt (Windows: PowerShell, Linux/Mac: Terminal)

## 2️⃣ Project Structure
Your project directory should have the following structure:

```plaintext
programming_test/          # Root directory
│── utils/                  # Directory for utility files
│   │── Q4_file.txt         # Sample input file for Q4
│   │── tinyEWD.txt         # Graph data file for Q3
│── assignment_solved/      # Directory for programming test solutions
│   │── Q1_sorting.py       # Sorting demonstration script (Q1)
│   │── Q2_search.py        # Separate Chaining Hash Table script (Q2)
│   │── Q3_hashtable.py     # Edge-weighted Digraph representation script (Q3)
│   │── Q4_file_reader.py   # File reading demonstration script (Q4)
│── main.py                 # Menu program to execute all questions
│── instruction.txt         # Instructions for running the project
```

## 3️⃣ How to Execute

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command:
    ```plaintext
    python main.py
    ```
4. Choose an option (Q1 - Q4) from the menu to execute the corresponding program.

5. View the results
`The output will be displayed directly in the terminal.`

❗ Notes:
- No additional installations `pip install` are required.
- Make sure all required files `(e.g., tinyEWD.txt, Q4_file.txt) `are present in the utils/ folder for the program to run correctly.

## 4️⃣ Additional Notes

The utils/ folder contains required text files:

- `tinyEWD.txt` must be present for Q3 to work.

- `Q4_file.txt` must be present for Q4 to work.
